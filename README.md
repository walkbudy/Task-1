## Data Cleaning Process

The dataset was cleaned and prepared for analysis using the following steps:

1. **Removed Blank Values:**  
   All missing or empty entries were identified and replaced with `NA` where necessary.

2. **Removed Duplicates:**  
   Duplicate records were detected and eliminated to ensure data consistency.

3. **Standardized Formatting:**  
   The data was reformatted for uniformity — column names, date formats, and text casing were standardized.

4. **Validated Entries:**  
   The dataset was checked to ensure there were no inconsistencies or invalid values remaining.

**Final Result:**  
A clean, non-duplicated, and consistently formatted dataset ready for analysis or modeling.
